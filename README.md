# CS7643_Final_Project
Using VAEs to train classifiers.

## File Descriptions:
* `beta_vae.ipynb` - notebook for our beta-VAE trained on the MNIST dataset.
* `bvae_classifier_mnist_v4.ipynb` - Two layer fully connected classifier that trains on the encoded representations of the beta-vae (`bVAE.pt`) on the MNIST dataset.
* `bvae_classifier_mnist_v3.ipynb` - Five layer fully connected classifier that trains on the encoded representations of the beta-vae (`bVAE.pt`) on the MNIST dataset.
* `beta_vae_quickdraw.ipynb` - notebook for our beta-VAE trained on the Quick Draw dataset.
